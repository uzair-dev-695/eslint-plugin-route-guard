# Express Basic Example

Basic Express application demonstrating route duplicate detection.

## Installation

npm install
```

## Run ESLint

```bash
npm run lint
```

## What This Demonstrates

- Basic route detection in Express
- Duplicate route detection
- HTTP method awareness (GET, POST, etc.)

## Expected Behavior

ESLint should detect the duplicate `/users` GET route in `app.js` and report an error.
